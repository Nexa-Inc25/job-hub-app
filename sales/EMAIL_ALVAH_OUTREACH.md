# Alvah Contractors Outreach

## Email Option 1: Cold Outreach (if no prior contact)

**To**: [Operations Manager / Owner email]  
**Subject**: Digital unit billing for your PG&E pole work

Hi [Name],

I noticed Alvah Contractors does pole replacement work for PG&E. We built a mobile app specifically for crews like yours that eliminates the paperwork headache around unit billing.

**FieldLedger** lets your foremen capture units on their phones with GPS-tagged photos. When they sync, everything's already organized and ready for billing – no more paper shuffling.

Contractors using it are seeing:
- 35 minutes saved per job on admin work
- Billing submitted same-day instead of waiting for paper
- 80% fewer claim rejections

I'd love to show you a 15-minute demo. Would next [Tuesday/Wednesday] work?

Best,
Mike

## Email Option 2: If You Know Someone There

**Subject**: Quick tool for your pole crews - can I show you?

Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing well. I built something I think your foremen would love.

It's a mobile app that lets them log units and take photos in the field – works even in dead zones. At the end of the day, everything's ready for billing. No paper, no re-keying into Excel.

Your PG&E pole types (T1-T5), accessible/inaccessible pricing – all built in.

Can I show you in 15 minutes? I'll buy the coffee. ☕

Mike

## Key Talking Points for Alvah

1. **They're already on PG&E property** – you know their pain
2. **CWA rates / pole types** – speak their language (T1-T5, accessible/inaccessible)
3. **Offline capability** – critical for remote pole locations
4. **As-built document order** – you know the PG&E requirements (Pole Bill, EC Tag, Face Sheet, etc.)
5. **Oracle FBDI export** – if they use Oracle, this is huge

## Objection Handling

**"We already have a system"**  
→ "What are you using today? Most contractors I talk to are on paper or Excel. FieldLedger works alongside that – foremen can still do paper as backup during the pilot."

**"Our foremen aren't tech-savvy"**  
→ "The app is simpler than texting. Literally: pick item, enter quantity, take photo, done. I've trained foremen in 15 minutes."

**"We're too busy right now"**  
→ "Totally get it. That's actually why this helps – it saves your foremen 30+ minutes per job on paperwork. When would be a better time to look at it? End of month?"

**"What does it cost?"**  
→ "The pilot is free for 30 days. After that, it's $49-79 per user per month. For a crew doing 50 jobs a month, the time savings alone is worth it – not counting faster payments."

**"How do I know my data is safe?"**  
→ "Your data is encrypted and completely isolated from other companies. We're working toward SOC 2 certification. And you can export all your data anytime."
