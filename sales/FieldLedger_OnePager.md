# FieldLedger
## Field Operations Platform for Utility Contractors

---

### The Problem

Utility contractors waste **10+ hours per week** on:
- Handwriting unit tickets in the field
- Manually assembling as-built packages
- Chasing down missing signatures and photos
- Re-keying data into Excel for billing
- Back-and-forth with estimating on rejected claims

**Result**: Delayed payments, rejected invoices, frustrated crews.
