**Subject**: Cutting billing admin time in half for [COMPANY NAME]

Hi [NAME],

I noticed [COMPANY NAME] does pole replacement work for PG&E – we built a tool specifically for crews like yours.

**FieldLedger** lets your foremen capture units and as-built docs on their phones, even offline. When they sync, everything's already organized and ready for billing.

Contractors using it are seeing:
- 35 minutes saved per job on paperwork
- 80% fewer rejected claims
- Billing submitted same-day instead of waiting for paper

We're running **free 30-day pilots** for a few qualified contractors. Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if it's a fit?

Best,
Mike

## Email 2: Follow-up (3 days later)

**Subject**: Re: Cutting billing admin time in half for [COMPANY NAME]

Hi [NAME],

Just bumping this up – I know you're busy in the field.

Quick question: How are your crews currently tracking units and assembling as-builts? Paper? Excel?

If it's working great, no worries. But if there's friction, I'd love to show you what we built.

15-minute demo, no pressure: [CALENDLY LINK]

**Subject**: Should I close your file?

Hi [NAME],

I haven't heard back, so I'll assume the timing isn't right.

If unit billing or as-built assembly ever becomes a headache, I'm here. Just reply to this email.

Good luck out there,
Mike

## Email 4: Referral Ask (to existing contacts)

**Subject**: Know any contractors drowning in paperwork?

Hey [NAME],

Hope things are going well. Quick ask:

Do you know any foremen or ops managers at utility contractors who complain about billing paperwork or as-built headaches?

I built a tool that's getting good results – would love an intro if anyone comes to mind.

Happy to return the favor anytime.
