# PG&E Construction Manager Outreach

---

## The Opportunity

A PG&E Construction Manager showing interest is **huge**:
- Direct utility validation
- Potential for PG&E to recommend/require FieldLedger for contractors
- Reference for Oracle Marketplace application
- Door to other PG&E programs (underground, transmission, etc.)

## Key Messaging for PG&E

### What They Care About

| PG&E Priority | How FieldLedger Helps |
|---------------|----------------------|
| **As-Built Quality** | Structured document capture, correct order per TD-2051P-10 |
| **CPUC Compliance** | Complete audit trail, GPS/timestamp verification |
| **Contractor Accountability** | Photo evidence, digital signatures, no missing docs |
| **Data Accuracy** | UTVAC compliance (Unambiguous, Traceable, Verifiable, Accurate, Complete) |
| **Faster Close-Out** | As-builts submitted same-day, not weeks later |
| **Cost Control** | Unit-price validation against CWA rates |

### Speak Their Language

- **PM Number** (not "job ID")
- **WO Number** (work order)
- **EC Tag** (equipment change tag)
- **Face Sheet** / **CCSC** / **Crew Instructions**
- **Pole Types 1-5** (per CWA Exhibit A)
- **Accessible vs Inaccessible**

## Email Templates for PG&E CM

### Email 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: Digital as-built solution for your contractor crews

Hi [Name],

I understand you manage construction contractors doing pole replacement for PG&E. I built a platform specifically for this work that I think you'd find interesting.

**FieldLedger** is a mobile-first app that lets contractor foremen capture as-built data in the field – GPS-tagged photos, unit quantities, digital signatures – all organized per TD-2051P-10 requirements.

For PG&E, this means:
- **Faster close-out** – As-builts submitted same-day, not 2 weeks later
- **Better compliance** – Complete audit trail with UTVAC-quality data
- **Fewer resubmissions** – Structured capture means fewer missing documents

We're already piloting with Alvah Contractors. Would you be open to a 20-minute demo to see if this could help your programs?

Best,
Mike

### Email 2: Follow-Up (If No Response)

**Subject**: Re: Digital as-built solution for your contractor crews

Hi [Name],

Just following up – I know you're busy managing contractors.

Quick question: What's your biggest pain point with as-built documentation today? Missing photos? Late submissions? Incomplete packages?

If it's something we've solved, I'd love to show you. If not, no worries – I'll leave you alone. 😊

Mike

### Email 3: If They Show Interest

**Subject**: FieldLedger demo for PG&E - scheduling

Hi [Name],

Great to connect! I'm looking forward to showing you the platform.

**What I'll cover in 20 minutes:**
1. How foremen capture units and photos in the field (works offline)
2. As-built document organization per PG&E requirements
3. Approval workflow for GFs and PMs
4. Reporting and export capabilities

**Before we meet, quick question:**
- Are there specific contractor pain points you're trying to solve?
- Any particular programs you're focused on (pole replacement, underground, etc.)?

Let me know what times work for you this week.

Mike

## Demo Script for PG&E CM

### Opening (2 min)
*"Thanks for taking the time. I'll show you exactly how contractors can use this to submit better as-builts faster. Feel free to interrupt with questions."*

### Foreman Workflow (5 min)
1. Show mobile app on phone
2. Open a sample job (use a PM number they'd recognize)
3. Show how foreman captures a unit:
   - Select pole type (T1-T5)
   - Enter quantity
   - Take photo with GPS
   - Add notes
4. Emphasize: **"Works offline in remote areas"**

### As-Built Document Flow (5 min)
1. Show document structure:
   - Pole Bill
   - EC Tag
   - Face Sheet
   - Equipment & Pole Info
   - Construction Feedback
   - Crew Instructions
   - Crew Materials
   - Map
   - CCSC
2. Explain: *"This matches your TD-2051P-10 requirements"*
3. Show photo attachment and GPS verification

### Approval & Compliance (5 min)
1. Show GF approval screen
2. Show audit log (*"Complete trail for CPUC if needed"*)
3. Show export/reporting

### Close (3 min)
*"What would it mean for your programs if contractors could submit complete, verified as-builts the same day the work is done?"*

**Ask:**
- *"Would this be valuable for your contractors?"*
- *"Who else at PG&E should see this?"*
- *"Would you be open to recommending a pilot to one of your contractor crews?"*

## What PG&E Gets (Not Just Contractors)

### Potential PG&E Use Cases

1. **Contractor Oversight**
   - Real-time visibility into contractor progress
   - Photo verification of completed work
   - Audit trail for regulatory inquiries

2. **As-Built Quality Control**
   - Structured data collection = fewer errors
   - Digital signatures = clear accountability
   - Automatic document ordering per TD-2051P

3. **Program Analytics**
   - How many poles replaced this month?
   - Average time from work to as-built submission?
   - Contractor performance comparison?

4. **Integration with PG&E Systems**
   - FBDI export compatible with Oracle
   - API available for SAP/other system integration
   - GIS data capture for mapping updates

## Possible Paths Forward

### Path A: Contractor Recommendation
PG&E CM recommends FieldLedger to their contractors as a tool to improve as-built quality.
→ We get contractor referrals with utility endorsement

### Path B: Pilot Program Requirement
PG&E includes FieldLedger in a pilot program contract requirement.
→ Guaranteed contractor adoption

### Path C: PG&E Direct License
PG&E licenses FieldLedger for their internal field crews (M&C, GC).
→ Enterprise deal

### Path D: Integration Partnership
PG&E integrates FieldLedger into their contractor portal / SAP system.
→ Long-term partnership, API integration work

## Objection Handling for PG&E

**"Our contractors already have their own systems"**
→ *"Most are using paper or Excel. FieldLedger standardizes the output so you get consistent, compliant as-builts regardless of which contractor submits."*

**"We can't mandate specific tools to contractors"**
→ *"Totally understand. This can be optional but recommended. Contractors who use it submit faster and with fewer rejections. That's a win for everyone."*

**"How does this integrate with SAP/Oracle?"**
→ *"We export FBDI-compatible files for Oracle Fusion. For SAP, we can work on an integration if there's interest. We also have an API."*

**"What about data security?"**
→ *"Contractor data is isolated by company. We're SOC 2 in progress, TLS 1.3 encryption, complete audit logging. Happy to share our security documentation."*

**"This seems like a contractor tool, not a utility tool"**
→ *"You're right – it's primarily for contractors. But you benefit because you get better data, faster. Some utilities are considering licensing it for visibility into contractor progress."*
